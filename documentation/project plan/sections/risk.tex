\section{Risk Analysis}
\label{sec:risk}

We distinguish between technical and organizational risks, where the former involve those related to the approach chosen to tackle the research problem, whereas the latter refer to those arising from the organization of work of the project team and related parties. In addition to the descriptions and contingency plans, justifications for the costs and likelihoods of the risks are provided.

		1 & 
		The team fails to build the RNN- or CNN-based model from TIMIT on time. &
		Prioritize this task over other tasks to speed up the implementation. For others tasks of which this task is a prerequisite, reallocate the assigned manpower to items with no dependency on this task.  &

\subsection{Organizational Risks}

		\midrule
		1 & 
		Testing data from childrenâ€™s speech cannot be collected before the methods need to be tested. &
		Re-launch data collection with more accessible test subjects, such as university students of younger age. &
