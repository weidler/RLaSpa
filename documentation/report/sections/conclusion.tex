\subsection{Future Work}
\label{subsec:futurework}
Since in our implementation we only use a Double Deep Q-Network it would be interesting to see if or how other policy networks, such as Rainbow \citep{rainbow} or hierarchical-DQN \citep{hierarchicalDeepRL}, are able to use the learned latent space. Furthermore, additional convolutional layers may be helpful for constructing a meaningful latent space. Since our results are promising it would be interesting to see our framework applied to Atari games.
