\label{sec:deliverables}

What we want to deliver is a method to transfer learning between different tasks. For this we will develop a framework for training and transferring knowledge from one task to another. The tasks need to have some similarities, otherwise you would not get a benefit from using previous knowledge. An interesting and easy to see environment for that are Atari games in which success is evaluated using the score the agent achieved. We will show that transfer learning helps the agent to adapt to a new environment quicker than using no prior knowledge. Furthermore, we want to give an insight into how transfer learning can be achieved and which important aspects need to be regarded to acquire a positive effect.
