REPORT TODOs:
------------

Adri
  - related work

Alessandro
  - load 500 000 ckpt and include recon in        results
  - *get figures with results of latent space created by CVAE/Janus/Cerberus for tunnel/scrollers
  - run transfer learning experiments
     - zero shot performance
     - learning speed improvement (run e.g. 10k episodes, gather performance avg every 100 and plot random init vs 	pretrained) (transfer)

Danni
  - gather results from cluster
  - analysis/description of isolated DQN results

Kevin
  - proofreading
  - future work/discussion notes

Tonio
  - go over approach, make it coherent, reorganize the parallel learning section
  - analysis of latent space results
  - optimize full model figure

Unassigned
  - Write abstract
  - future work
