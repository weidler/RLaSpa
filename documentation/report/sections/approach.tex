\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}
We propose a modular framework for transfer learning in reinforcement learning. 
The framework consists three modules: 
1) the \textbf{representation learner}, which constructs an abstract representation of the task environment;
2) the \textbf{policy learner}, which is RL learner operating based on the task abstraction created by the representation learner;
3) the \textbf{task environment}, which is the RL tasks to be solved by policy learner.

\subsection{Representation Learners}
The representation learner aims to construct an abstract and generalized representation of the task environment to facilitate later knowledge transfer.
Our framework includes several architectures as visualized in Figure \ref{fig:repr_learner}.
The architectures all include some lower-dimensional ``bottleneck'' layers, 
which are designed to enforce dimensionality reduction of the input.
Once learned, this intermediate latent space is expected to create a more compact and abstract representation of the original environment and serve as the basis of transfer learning.

\subsubsection{Simple and Variational Autoencoder}
The simplest representation learner is an autoencoder, which compresses and reconstructs the current state representation. 
Figure \ref{subfig:repr_learner_simple_autoencoder} illustrates the simple autoencoder, and \ref{subfig:repr_learner_vae} the variational autoencoder (VAE). 
%The VAE . 
However, one theoretical drawback is that
since the latent space only aims at compression, it is not necessarily a useful basis for transfer learning.
The upcoming architectures account for this.

\subsubsection{Janus}
To create more guidance in the construction of the latent space, we add another sub-network to capture the transition dynamics. 
As shown in Figure \ref{subfig:repr_learner_janus},
in addition to reconstructing the current state, we also append the action in latent space and seek to use this combination to predict the next state.
The hypothesized effect of this approach is that the latent representation can preserve the transition dynamics in the environment, and therefore is a more meaningful abstraction of the task.


\subsubsection{Cerberus}
Compared to Janus, the Cerberus architecture has one more output sub-network, which aims to construct the difference between the current and next state. 
By only predicting the differences, focus is placed on the change caused by the action taken.
This is especially useful when the changes between consecutive states are small relative to the entire state representation.
The network architecture is shown in Figure \ref{subfig:repr_learner_cerberus}.  

\subsection{Policy Learners}
Based on the latent space constructed by the representation learner (marked in purple), the policy learner is RL agent that...

learn values of states.
